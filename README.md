Input: Intervals = [{1,3},{2,4},{6,8},{9,10}] 
Output: {{1, 4}, {6, 8}, {9, 10}} 
Explanation: Given intervals: [1,3],[2,4],[6,8],[9,10], we have only two overlapping intervals here,[1,3] and [2,4]. Therefore we will merge these two and return [1,4],[6,8], [9,10]. 

Input: Intervals = {{6,8},{1,9},{2,4},{4,7}} 
Output: {{1, 9}}
